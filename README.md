# AI Driven Software Testing Foundation

Welcome to the AI Driven Software Testing Foundation - a community dedicated to contributing to AI-driven software testing.

## Our Mission
We believe that AI testing capabilities should be open source and accessible, not locked behind paywalls. Our goal is to democratize AI-driven software testing by emphasizing its uses in software testing, creating and contributing to make free, open source solutions that everyone can use, modify, and improve.

We believe that AI (CNN, ML, LLM, Gen AI etc.) can help testers and empower them in their day-to-day work. 

• **Image-based Feature Extraction**: AI can be utilized in test automation for feature extraction from images when traditional locators are ineffective, inexistant or too expensive to implement.

• **Predictive Analytics for Test Prioritization**: Machine learning algorithms can predict which tests are most likely to fail based on historical data, allowing teams to prioritize testing efforts effectively.

• **Natural Language Processing for Test Script Creation**: AI can convert natural language requirements into automated test scripts, making it easier for non-technical stakeholders to contribute to the testing process.
